          <p class="author"> Jorge Luis Borges</p>
          <p class="hidestory">
            The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and
            perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between,
            surrounded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see,
            interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is
            invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except
            two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that
            of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which
            opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and
            right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep
            standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here
            passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote
            distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all
            appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it
            were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces
            represent and promise the infinite ... Light is provided by some spherical fruit
            which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each
            hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.
            <br><br>Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in
            search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can
            hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the
            hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious
            hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body
            will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall,
            which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the
            hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our
            intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is
            inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular
            chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which
            follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their
            words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the
            classic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its
            hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.
            <br><br>There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains
            thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages;
            each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in
            color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not
            indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one
            time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in
            spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall
            a few axioms.
            <br><br>First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is
            the future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable
            mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent
            demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical
            volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated
            librarian, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the
            divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols
            which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters
            inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
            <br><br>Second: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number. This finding
            made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the
            Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered:
            perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted
            in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time
            thy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of
            straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal
            jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians
            repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and
            equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's
            palm ... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five
            natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the
            books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely
            fallacious.)
            <br><br>
            For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded
            to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first
            librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true
            that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther
            pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how
            dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could
            influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71
            was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page,
            but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally,
            this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was
            formulated by its originators.

            <b>1. Floating City</b>
            <br>The floating city appeared suddenly before everyone’s eye in the middle of sky like a hydrogen-filled balloon on a clear, bright day many years ago. Rolling clouds swirled by above; waves crashed on the swelling sea below. The floating city hovered, going neither up nor down as it maintained its position, buffered slightly by the breeze.
            Only our grandparents’ grandparents witnessed how it all began. It had been an unbelievable and terrifying experience, one they recalled fearfully. There had been a violent collision of clouds lighting up the sky with flashes and roars of thunder. On the sea countless pirate vessels had run up the skull and crossbones and fired their cannon nonstop. Suddenly the floating city had dropped form the clouds and hung in midair.
            Many years passed. Our grandparents’ grandparents passed away, and our grandparents followed them into a deep sleep. By and by the story they had told became a mysterious legend.
            The grandchildren settled in the city and gradually adapted to living there. Even its legend faded. Finally, the majority of people came to believe that the floating city had always hung in the sky, neither rising nor sinking. Even when it was buffeted by the wind and shook ever so slightly, it was like swinging on a swing.
            Many more years passed.</p>

            Two young gentlemen dressed just like British military men, with gleaming guns on their shoulders and two dogs like great white bears at their heels, were walking in the mountains where the leaves rustled dry underfoot. They were talking as they went.
            <br><br>‘I must say, the country around here is really awful,’ said one.
            ‘<br><br>Not a bird or beast in sight. I’m just dying to let fly at something: <i>bang, bang</i>! Anything, so long as it moves.’
            <br><br>‘Yes, what fun it would be to let a deer or something have a couple of shots smack in his tawny flank!’ said the other. ‘I can just see him spinning around, then flopping down with a thud.’
            <br><br>They really were very deep in the mountains. So deep, in fact, that the professional hunter who had come as their guide went astray and wandered off somewhere. Worse still, the forest was so frightening that the two bearlike dogs both got dizzy, howled for a while, then foamed at the mouth and died.
            <br><br>‘Do you realize that dog cost me two thousand four hundred silver pieces?’ said one young gentleman, casually turning its eyelids back.
            <br><br><i>‘Mine</i> cost me two thousand eight hundred,’ said the other, his head tilted ruefully to one side.
            <br><br>The first young gentleman went pale.
            <br><br>‘I think I’ll be getting back,’ he said, gazing into the other’s face. ‘As a matter of fact,’ said his friend, ‘I was just beginning to get a bit cold and hungry myself, so I think I’ll join you.’
            <br><br>‘Then let’s call it a day. What does it matter? On our way back we can drop in at yesterday’s inn and buy a few game birds to take home with us.’
            <br><br>‘They had hares too, didn’t they? So it’ll come to the same thing in the end. Well, why don’t we go home then?’
            <br><br>But the annoying thing was that by now they no longer had the faintest idea of the way back.
            <br><br>A sudden gust of wind sprang up; the grass stirred, the leaves rustled and the trees creaked and groaned.
            <br><br>'I really am hungry,’ said one. ‘I’ve had an awful hollow feeling under my ribs for quite a while.’
            <br><br>‘So have I,’ said the other. ‘I don’t feel like walking any farther.’
            <br><br>‘O for something to eat!’ said the first.
            <br><br>The pampas grass was rustling all about them as they talked.
            <br><br>Just then, one of them happened to look around, and what should he see standing there but a fine brick building. Over the entrance was a notice that said, in large letters:
            <br><br><br><b>RESTAURANT WILDCAT HOUSE</b>
            <br><br><br>‘Look! This is perfect,’ said one. The place is civilised after all. Why don’t we go in.’ Funny,’ said the other, ‘finding it in a place like this. But I expect we’ll be able to get a meal, at any rate.’
            <br><br>‘Of course we will, silly. What do you think the sign means?’
            <br><br>‘Let’s give it a try. I’m just about collapsing with hunger.’
            <br><br>They stepped into the entrance hall, which was very splendid, being done all over in white tiles. There was a glass door, with something written on it in gold letters.

            In the living room the voice-clock sang, Tick-tock, seven o'clock, time to get up, time to get up,
            seven o 'clock! as if it were afraid that nobody would. The morning house lay empty. The clock
            ticked on, repeating and repeating its sounds into the emptiness. <i>Seven-nine, breakfast time,
            seven-nine!</i>
            <br><br>In the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight pieces
            of perfectly browned toast, eight eggs sunny side up, sixteen slices of bacon, two coffees, and two
            cool glasses of milk.
            <br><br>"Today is August 4, 2026," said a second voice from the kitchen ceiling, "in the city of
            Allendale, California." It repeated the date three times for memory's sake. "Today is Mr.
            Featherstone's birthday. Today is the anniversary of Tilita's marriage. Insurance is payable,
            as are the water, gas, and light bills."
            <br><br>Somewhere in the walls, relays clicked, memory tapes glided under electric eyes.
            <br><br><i>Eight-one, tick-tock, eight-one o'clock, off to school, off to work, run, run, eight-one!</i> But no
            doors slammed, no carpets took the soft tread of rubber heels. It was raining outside. The weather
            box on the front door sang quietly: "Rain, rain, go away; umbrellas, raincoats for today. .." And
            the rain tapped on the empty house, echoing.
            <br><br>Outside, the garage chimed and lifted its door to reveal the waiting car. After a long wait the door
            swung down again.
            <br><br>At eight-thirty the eggs were shrivelled and the toast was like stone. An aluminium wedge scraped
            them into the sink, where hot water whirled them down a metal throat which digested and flushed
            them away to the distant sea. The dirty dishes were dropped into a hot washer and emerged
            twinkling dry.
