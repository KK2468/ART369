          Websites are maps, very interactive maps. They're the kind of map that lets you teleport wherever you choose to go in the blink of an eye, with just a single
          <b><i><span style="font-size: 50">click</span></i></b>
          Like maps, websites take you places and can help build connections
          (imagine the world wide web as
          <a href="https://heroeswiki.com/images/1/1d/Interactive_map_extracted.jpg">
            one of those maps
          </a>
            with a bunch of pins and connecting strings on a bulletin board). You can go from one place to another, and another, and another, and so on...the possibilities are endless.
            And in this way, websites do more than just tell us where we are, or where we could go.
            Yes, they are the maps that let us travel, explore, delve into, and navigate through different realms in an <i><b>instant</b></i>.
            But they also give us a chance to express ourselves, and create our own, unique little world to add to this seemingly infinite digital universe.
          <br><br><br>
            So if the website is a map, then I suppose surfing the web could be closing your
            <a href="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DelightfulTenderBetafish-size_restricted.gif">eyes</a>
             ,randomly picking a spot on the map, and choosing to go wherever your finger lands.
             Of course, with search engines, there’s more direction to surfing the web than just that..However,it can still be just as spontaneous (especially once you get to clicking on and being redirected to other links/webpages)...

              Websites are also like the <em>fungi</em> of the underground mycorrhizal networks that allows plants and trees to communicate and share information as well as resources (like nutrients).
              <i>(but they can also spread toxic chemicals as well even though most of these networks establish mutually-beneficial relationships)</i>
              Much like the interwebs, mycorrhizal networks have the power to facilitate long-distance communication between groups and individuals through a mass of thin threads (<i>mycelium</i>)
              that link together the roots of different plants. In this way, the connection often goes unnoticed, or perhaps is taken for granted because so much happens in the background.
              Our world wide web is really not that different from this "wood wide web" (as scientists have dubbed it); a lot of connections and communication is made in the "<b>dark</b>"...or at least,
              well, to me at least, it seems like everything happening on the internet seems to be part of a separate digital world, and so it's in the background...I suppose that might also have to do
              with the fact that communication is being facilitated through a medium, so it seems to be more in the background...
              <br><br>But <i>anyway</i>, websites and the internet, like these fungal networks, have the capacity to help the individuals that it connects:
              people from <u>different</u> parts of the world, <u>different</u> cultures, with <u>different</u> beliefs and <u>different</u> ways of life are, and can be connected to each other through the web,
              and that people could help and interact with each other. There is so much to be shared, and so much to be learned from all parts of the world, and this is now possible because of the internet, a system
              reminiscent of this fungal network model.

                  What <i>I</i> learned from the readings, also, is that websites are alive...and thus might not always be <b>permanent</b>.
                  While some websites can live forever, others may live for only mere seconds or minutes as web designers brainstorm and/or trash idea after idea.
                  Like life, websites/webpages are just as ephemeral.
                  <br><br>It's <em>incredible</em> to me to think that the web, the internet, is still relatively young--it's <i>barely</i> 31! and it's still in the process of

                  <i><b>g
                  <span style="font-size: 40">r</span>
                  <span style="font-size: 50">o</span>
                  <span style="font-size: 60">w</span>

                  <span style="font-size: 90">g</span></b></i>
                  and developing.
                  Just like living things, the internet (& co.) takes <a href="https://howoldistheinter.net/index.php">time</a> to grow and mature.
                  In this way, because of this "alive-ness" quality, the internet also has the ability to change.

                    I like the metaphor of a website as a plant and a garden because they require time and care to develop
                    <i>(as discussed with relation to the internet's<a href = "#alive"> aliveness</a>)</i>.
                    In this way, we design, then is like a horticulturalist designing the garden (<i>webpage</i>)in a way that’s not only visually appealing for visitors, but also enhances the <em>overall</em> experience of the visitor within the place.
                    <br><br>And if we’re talking about a botanic garden, then the web becomes a way for the web designer to communicate the information <i>(the plants displayed/grown in the garden)</i> in an engaging, fun, and interactive way.
